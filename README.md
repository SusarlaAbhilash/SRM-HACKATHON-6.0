CROP YIELD PREDICTOR

#The AI BASED FORECASTING MODEL TO PREDICT YIELD answers the problem
Crop yield predictions were heavily influenced by the weather. The impact of weather on agricultural yield might be regarded an important factor in crop yield forecast. They and agriculture around the country are suffering as a result of unexpected changes in weather conditions, as farmers are unable to produce adequate crops. So, by estimating the values of environmental characteristics such as soil moisture, humidity, temperature, pressure, and luminosity (sunlight) obtained via on-ground sensors, farmers may forecast the crop's eventual output. Manual surveys were used in conventional yield forecasts, and they required precise information about the crop (e.g., assessing their health, counting the plants, pest damage, and unfavourable weather, etc.)

Manual surveys, on the other hand, are time-consuming and costly. With the implementation of remote sensing techniques, decision makers can visualise all of the crop lands, as well as other associated information and their current state. With these technologies, yield estimation can be completed in half the time or even less time, with a lesser number of resources and higher accuracy. As a result, it is easier for farmers to plan ahead in terms of irrigation needs and any other precautions that can boost crop quality and quantity.
